#### Restaurant universitaire (lunches)

The lunches will be taken in the back room of the faculty restaurant ("*Restaurant Universitaire*" on the [campus map](images/campus_luminy.pdf)). Beware, the restaurant has separate queues and rooms for students and for the personnel. We will have our lunches at the rear of the restaurant, in the "personnel" area.

###  Hotel Information

We advise to book hotels either around **Vieux Port** area, or between **Castellane** to **Rond point du Prado** area. Those are the most convenient areas for commute to Luminy, nearby city center and nearby Buses and Metro lines. 

### Marseille Information

In order to ensure easy access to the campus Luminy as well as to the City center, the most convenient is to find an hotel between Prado and Castellane. We had good feedback from hosts of CITADINES PRADO CHANOT MARSEILLE (9-11 Boulevard du Louvain, Marseille, 13008, France), who are renting studios for a reasonable price. Other hotels and studio rental can be found in the neighborhood.
