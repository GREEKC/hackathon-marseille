## Expectated deliveries

### Final goal

At the end of the hackathon, we aim at providing a fully automated workflow relying as much as possible on APIs wihout having to download the full datasetsa dn parse them locally. 


### Intermediate goals and milestones

After day 1, ...

After day 2, ...

### Deliverables

- A workflow in R markdown document
- Examples of utiliation with selected study cases
- A Shiny-based Web interface to the workflow
- Full code of the workflow available in github
- A user documentation enabling biologists to run the anlayses on  their own computer
