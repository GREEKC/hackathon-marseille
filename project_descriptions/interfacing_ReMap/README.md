# Interfacing ReMap2020 (in dev locally) with REST API

## Motivation

We are currently developping the new web interface of ReMap. 
It runs on: 
- Laravel
- AdminLTE template
- MySQL
- Adminer
We want to make our resource interoperable.

- Ask Aziz & Thomas
- Which tool to use

## Which REST queries to make ?
Ask users, and list below the queries.
- Fetch all available datasets given a TF name
- Fetch all available datasets given a Biotype name

## Deliverable

- Basic Documentation of REST code

## Expected attendees
