###  Hackathon presentations

TO BE COMPLETED: we will create a folder with all the participants presentations

###  Hotel Information

We advise to book hotels around `View Port` area, and between `Castellane` to `Rond point du Prado` area. 
Those are the most convenient areas for commute to Luminy, nearby city center and nearby Buses and Metro lines. 

### Marseille Information

In order to ensure easy access to the campus Luminy as well as to the City center, the most convenient is to find an hotel between Prado and Castellane. We had good feedback from hosts of CITADINES PRADO CHANOT MARSEILLE (9-11 Boulevard du Louvain, Marseille, 13008, France), who are renting studios for a reasonable price. Other hotels and studio rental can be found in the neighborhood.

### Calanques hike

Starting fromn the Luminy campus, we will walk to the [calanques](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massif_des_Calanques), first to the `Belvedere` (view point), and then down to the [Calanque of Sugiton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calanque_de_Sugiton). 


IMPORTANT NOTE : This is a ~3h hike on realtively good terrain, but dress accordingly if you come. Have at least some good shoes (trainers are ok) and a little back pack with water (1.5L). The sea temperature is `cold` around 14/15 degres, some might be interested in dipping their toes.
