## Social Events

### Calanques hike

Starting from the Luminy campus, we will walk to the [calanques](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massif_des_Calanques), first to the `Belvedere` (view point), and then down to the [Calanque of Sugiton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calanque_de_Sugiton). 


IMPORTANT NOTE : This is a ~3h hike on realtively good terrain, but dress accordingly if you come. Have at least some good shoes (trainers are ok) and a little back pack with water (1.5L). The sea temperature is `cold` around 14/15 degres, some might be interested in dipping their toes.

## Diners 

Please register to the Google sheet for lunches and dinners. 

<http://tinyurl.com/greekc-mrs19-participants>

- On April 24 and 25, the lunches will be paid by us.
- All the other meals (lunches and dinners) have to be paid by each participant, with a flat-rate refund of 20€ per meal, to be claimed on the COST Web site.
- On April 23 and 26, the lunches will be taken at the cafetaria of the university, with a cost of ~7.5€. Dinners will likely be more expensive than 20€ but the weaker cost of the lunch will hopefully compensate. 

## Social event

The social event (Thursday April 25 PM) is a hike to the [Calanque de Sugiton](http://www.calanques13.com/en/calanque-sugiton.html) (it is of course free of charge), starting from the campus Luminy. This includes a ~40 minutes walk from Luminy to the Calanques, and ~50' for the way back.
