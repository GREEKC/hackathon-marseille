## Social event

The social event (Thursday April 25 PM) is a hike to the [Calanque de Sugiton](http://www.calanques13.com/en/calanque-sugiton.html) (it is of course free of charge). 

Starting from the Luminy campus, we will walk to the [calanques](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massif_des_Calanques), first to the `Belvedere` (view point), and then down to the [Calanque of Sugiton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calanque_de_Sugiton). 

IMPORTANT NOTE : This is a ~3h hike on realtively good terrain, but dress accordingly if you come. Have at least some good shoes (trainers are ok) and a little back pack with water (1.5L). The sea temperature is `cold` around 14/15 degres, some might be interested in dipping their toes.
